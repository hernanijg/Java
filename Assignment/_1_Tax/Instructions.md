# InvoiceDetail - Exercise

The task consists of creating a new class with a main method called `InvoiceDetail`. The program should receive invoice data using the `Scanner` class as follows:

1. Receive the invoice name/description (use `nextLine()` to get names with spaces).
2. Receive 2 product prices as `double` (use `nextDouble()` to get decimal prices).
3. Calculate the total: sum both prices and add a 19% tax.

**Expected Output:**
Display in a single String: the invoice name, gross total (pre-tax), tax amount, and net total (including tax).
